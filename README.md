# Horiseon Homepage Update - SEO and Accessibility

Horiseon's webpage required refactoring. The page and its code are made to be more concise and user-friendly. 

* The content and aside no longer lose formatting and position if the browser window were resized. 
* The links now remain on the header background field and change attributes with hover, click, and visited. 
* Image alt text added for search engine optimization and accessibility as outlined by Web Content Assessibility Guidelines. 
* Header background image resized for easier loading.
* Semantic Elements used to minimize confusion in layout.
* CSS elements combined where appropriate for more concise styling.
* Positions formatting changed for smoother transitions in size and accessibility purposes.
